### Last week

- We installed Git, VSCode, Anaconda Python
- We used the command line to:
  - launch programs that are in the PATH variable
  - move around the file hierarchy (`ls`, `pwd`, ...)
  - open an OS window in the current path of the command line
  - open a command in a given OS window
- We created our own github repository to host this project
- We cloned it on our own laptop
